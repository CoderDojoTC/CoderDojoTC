Scratch \u00b6 Scratch This is an ideal site if your students don't yet have strong keyboarding skills. For example can they use the copy/cut and paste functions without using the mouse? Scratch is a very popular block programming language supported by MIT. Students can build small programs just by placing blocks on the screen. You can learn more about scratch by visiting the MIT Scratch web site . Ages: 7-14 Python \u00b6 Python - If your student has strong keyboarding then we strongly recommend you start with Python. Python has been the most popular introductory programming language since 2014 because it is has a clean syntax and there are many tools especially designed for beginners. Our starting curriculum is based on the popular Trinket system used by many on-line coding clubs. Trinket is fully web-based and does not require any software to be installed. We also have many advanced Python labs and a gentle pathway to data literacy using Jupyter Notebooks. Ages: 10-18 Java \u00b6 Java - Java is suggested after students have mastered Python concepts. Getting started with Java is a bit more challenging since even small programs require more code and a deeper understanding of complex programming concepts. We are still working on finding instructors and materials for Java. Stand by for more. Ages: 14-18 Linux/UNIX and Pi \u00b6 Linux/UNIX and Raspberry Pi - Students that want to do work with the Raspberry Pi often need to understand basic UNIX commands and basic UNIX shell programming. We are working on putting these materials on line. Ages: 12-18 Web and User Experience \u00b6 Web and User Experience - Creating web pages is a fun way to learn how to build great user experiences.

A good way to learn Markdown is to use a Markdown cheat sheet . We want you to put many images into your classes so make sure to use the image links! We use GitHub to store our content. GitHub is free for all public content and has many advanced features that allow team to work together to build and test learning content. Many of our content authors are familiar with GitHub. We use GitHub Pages to publish our content to microsites. Each coding group has their own microsite and search does not currently work across the microsites (we are working on fixing this). All content should be published into a gh-deploy branch. If you change content using the web-based editor (the pencil in the upper right corner of the github page viewer - you may need to have a friend help republish the content to the GitHub Pages site.) We use mkdocs for our publishing tool. To deploy mkdocs you will need to have python installed on your local computer. You must run the \"mkdocs gh-deploy\" command every time you make changes. We use the mkdocs material theme . We encourage you to learn to add custom material widgets to your content. We use CoderDojo style guide for our colors, icons and fonts. Please try to stay close to these guidelines so that mentors, parents, and students all know they are on a kid-safe site. Try to avoid links to resources that are not kid-safe. By using these standards it will enable us to reuse this content for search, recommendation and building tools that allow students to use chatbots to help them code. Images \u00b6 All images should be stored in the doc/img directory in your site. Please keep images reasonably small (under 50K) to keep the load times fast. Navigation \u00b6 Make sure when you add a new content file you link it into the navigation menu. Try to keep navigation lists under 30 items. Try using nesting if your lists get too long. Mkdocs commands \u00b6 There are only four mkdocs commands. You will rarely need to use the new command. mkdocs build \u00b6 Build the MkDocs documentation.

Concept cards follow the rule \"one concept per card\". They are also called \"Sushi Cards\" in the CoderDojo mentoring system, representing a single bite of knowledge. Concepts are communicated in easy-to-digest, bite-sized chunks (hence Sushi). When should they be used? \u00b6 Concept Cards are ideal for situations where students may not have one-on-one time with a teacher or mentor This is a somewhat self-guided instruction without having to pick up a 300-page book where you have to start on page one. Think of them as \"Agile Teaching\" tools where there are multiple entry points into learning and the requirements of your students may be constantly changing. If designed correctly, concepts cards allow you to remix concepts to adapt to different students, projects and educational events. Design goals \u00b6 Breaking complex topics down into many small concepts is a universal strategy in designing any curriculum. We often call this process decomposition. Having a good set of concepts can promote building flexible data structures that are used in learning management systems. Sometimes designing a graph of interrelated concepts is a first step in building these systems. Once you have a hierarchy of concepts with their dependencies you can then focus on designing the content to teach these concepts. Guideline 1: One Card, One Concept Each concept card should teach one important concept. What is an important concept? That's the tricky bit \u2013 and that's for the card designer to decide. There is no scientific way of defining this! Sometimes a Concept can be associated with a specific physical demonstration like \"What is a Raspberry Pi computer?\" Sometimes they are associated with a program, like the UNIX shell command, and sometimes Concept Cards are associated with a programming concept like an if/then statement or a for a loop. (a for a? not sure if this is correct) Ideally, Concept Cards should be related to a piece of hardware, a program, a function and sample code that illustrates the principle as simply and clearly as possible. Don't be tempted to add in 'side' lessons that show something else. Instead, make these into separate cards. Side concepts may be interesting to you, but you must resist the temptation to deviate from the concept. Types of Concept Cards \u00b6 Concept cards are often divided into multiple difficulty levels like the following: Beginning - where a concept does not depend on any other concepts in your curriculum Intermediate - where a concept might depend on one or more Beginning concept Advanced - where a concept depends on one or more intermediate concepts Designing Colorful Laminated Concept Cards \u00b6 Like many communication tools, remember that the medium is the message. Concept cards are often colorful two-sided laminated cards that are easy to hold in one hand and easy to view by the side of a computer. The structure of the cards is important because they don't look intimidating. We want them to look a bit like a stack of playing cards, not a 1,000 page college textbook. Learners can move at their own pace and there is never the suggestion that only those patient enough to read a 300 page textbook are allowed to participate. You can easily place the card next to a piece of hardware or laptop. For instance, if they\u2019re learning UNIX, they\u2019ll probably have three or four windows open \u2013 so having another open to show the class notes is contributing to serious window management problems. Lamination \u2013 lamination will save you time and money. Laminators cost around $50. The individual laminating pouches are less than 10 cents each. Once you\u2019ve produced your laminated sheet it will last for many weeks of Dojo sessions, in contrast to paper handouts which are usually discarded after one or two Dojos. Test, test, test (practice-led, not theory-led) Because every audience is different, you can't really predict if cards will work for any audience. The approach is practice-led rather than theory-led so that learners see results as fast as possible. We think this mirrors the way most programmers learn anyway. (First, take some existing code and hack it, read up the theory only if you can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s going on \u2026) Keep examples short and sweet Any example code should be as short as possible (to minimize mistyping) and should be as easy to understand as possible \u2013 make examples as concrete as you can. Using self-descriptive variable and parameter names is helpful (good programming anyway). Don\u2019t feel you have to explain everything Don't feel you have to explain everything \u2013 it's often better to show some self-descriptive code and then ask the learner the question 'can you figure out what this is doing?' or 'how would you change this to do X'. You\u2019re pointing learners in the right direction, but you're not watching over them for the whole journey. Also \u2026 improvisation should be encouraged. Learning examples should be presented in such a way that the learner can riff on the examples and quickly produce new materials that showcase their own interests. Cards should be self-contained Although the lessons should be built on one another, individual cards should still be fairly self-contained. In the HTML example it's necessary to do the first two or three cards in order, but after the learner has created a basic site card it could be picked up in any order. (Although to make this work, you may need to revisit earlier cards after you add in a later card). Pictures are good Having the materials look inviting is important. The best practice is to have a friendly, not-too-complex, yet colorful picture at the top of each card just below the concept name. We try to show an end-result that looks exciting and makes learners want to dive in. Try to avoid having English in your pictures due to hassle made when translating to other languages. The cards will never be perfect \u2013 don\u2019t worry! Whenever you work with learners and use the cards, you\u2019ll quickly come across all sorts of errors, imperfections and barriers to comprehension. But don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s normal. Just go home and modify them. Each change you make will make the cards easier to use. Sample Structure * Front Material Difficulty - the outer border of the card should show the difficulty level using a bright color. We use green for beginning concepts, blue for intermediate concepts and black for advanced concepts. Also use text because some students may be color blind. Concept Name - try to use a short kid-friendly name and avoid technical jargon if possible Concept Picture - a small image or icon that students will remember if they have seen it before. Imagine students all arriving in a room and quickly discarding cards they have already done but putting their focus on new concept cards. Activity Challenge - A short list of activities that the students might try. Give them hints at the very bottom of the card if they are hard challenges. * Back Material Activity Answers - A short list answer to the challenges on the front of the card Explorations - More ways to learn more about a concept or related Concepts Design Tips \u00b6 Use colors and paragraphs to prevent a \"wall of text\" that will turn students away. Put in a colorful icon in the text or use bold/italic or colors to highlight words. Large blocks of text can be intimidating to readers and tough to read for all.

Concept cards follow the rule \"one concept per card\". They are also called \"Sushi Cards\" in the CoderDojo mentoring system, representing a single bite of knowledge. Concepts are communicated in easy-to-digest, bite-sized chunks (hence Sushi).","title":"What are Concept Cards?"},{"location":"designing-concept-cards/#when-should-they-be-used","text":"Concept Cards are ideal for situations where students may not have one-on-one time with a teacher or mentor This is a somewhat self-guided instruction without having to pick up a 300-page book where you have to start on page one. Think of them as \"Agile Teaching\" tools where there are multiple entry points into learning and the requirements of your students may be constantly changing. If designed correctly, concepts cards allow you to remix concepts to adapt to different students, projects and educational events.","title":"When should they be used?"},{"location":"designing-concept-cards/#design-goals","text":"Breaking complex topics down into many small concepts is a universal strategy in designing any curriculum. We often call this process decomposition. Having a good set of concepts can promote building flexible data structures that are used in learning management systems. Sometimes designing a graph of interrelated concepts is a first step in building these systems. Once you have a hierarchy of concepts with their dependencies you can then focus on designing the content to teach these concepts. Guideline 1: One Card, One Concept Each concept card should teach one important concept. What is an important concept? That's the tricky bit \u2013 and that's for the card designer to decide. There is no scientific way of defining this! Sometimes a Concept can be associated with a specific physical demonstration like \"What is a Raspberry Pi computer?\" Sometimes they are associated with a program, like the UNIX shell command, and sometimes Concept Cards are associated with a programming concept like an if/then statement or a for a loop. (a for a? not sure if this is correct) Ideally, Concept Cards should be related to a piece of hardware, a program, a function and sample code that illustrates the principle as simply and clearly as possible. Don't be tempted to add in 'side' lessons that show something else. Instead, make these into separate cards. Side concepts may be interesting to you, but you must resist the temptation to deviate from the concept.","title":"Design goals"},{"location":"designing-concept-cards/#types-of-concept-cards","text":"Concept cards are often divided into multiple difficulty levels like the following: Beginning - where a concept does not depend on any other concepts in your curriculum Intermediate - where a concept might depend on one or more Beginning concept Advanced - where a concept depends on one or more intermediate concepts","title":"Types of Concept Cards"},{"location":"designing-concept-cards/#designing-colorful-laminated-concept-cards","text":"Like many communication tools, remember that the medium is the message. Concept cards are often colorful two-sided laminated cards that are easy to hold in one hand and easy to view by the side of a computer. The structure of the cards is important because they don't look intimidating. We want them to look a bit like a stack of playing cards, not a 1,000 page college textbook. Learners can move at their own pace and there is never the suggestion that only those patient enough to read a 300 page textbook are allowed to participate. You can easily place the card next to a piece of hardware or laptop. For instance, if they\u2019re learning UNIX, they\u2019ll probably have three or four windows open \u2013 so having another open to show the class notes is contributing to serious window management problems. Lamination \u2013 lamination will save you time and money. Laminators cost around $50. The individual laminating pouches are less than 10 cents each. Once you\u2019ve produced your laminated sheet it will last for many weeks of Dojo sessions, in contrast to paper handouts which are usually discarded after one or two Dojos. Test, test, test (practice-led, not theory-led) Because every audience is different, you can't really predict if cards will work for any audience. The approach is practice-led rather than theory-led so that learners see results as fast as possible. We think this mirrors the way most programmers learn anyway. (First, take some existing code and hack it, read up the theory only if you can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s going on \u2026) Keep examples short and sweet Any example code should be as short as possible (to minimize mistyping) and should be as easy to understand as possible \u2013 make examples as concrete as you can. Using self-descriptive variable and parameter names is helpful (good programming anyway). Don\u2019t feel you have to explain everything Don't feel you have to explain everything \u2013 it's often better to show some self-descriptive code and then ask the learner the question 'can you figure out what this is doing?' or 'how would you change this to do X'. You\u2019re pointing learners in the right direction, but you're not watching over them for the whole journey. Also \u2026 improvisation should be encouraged. Learning examples should be presented in such a way that the learner can riff on the examples and quickly produce new materials that showcase their own interests. Cards should be self-contained Although the lessons should be built on one another, individual cards should still be fairly self-contained. In the HTML example it's necessary to do the first two or three cards in order, but after the learner has created a basic site card it could be picked up in any order. (Although to make this work, you may need to revisit earlier cards after you add in a later card). Pictures are good Having the materials look inviting is important. The best practice is to have a friendly, not-too-complex, yet colorful picture at the top of each card just below the concept name. We try to show an end-result that looks exciting and makes learners want to dive in. Try to avoid having English in your pictures due to hassle made when translating to other languages. The cards will never be perfect \u2013 don\u2019t worry!
