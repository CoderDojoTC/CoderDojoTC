Scratch This is an ideal site if your students don't yet have strong keyboarding skills. For example can they use the copy/cut and paste functions without using the mouse? Scratch is a very popular block programming language supported by MIT. Students can build small programs just by placing blocks on the screen. You can learn more about scratch by visiting the MIT Scratch web site . Python - If your student has strong keyboarding then we strongly recommend you start with Python. Python has been the most popular introductory programming language since 2014 because it is has a clean syntax and there are many tools especially designed for beginners. Our starting curriculum is based on the popular Trinket system used by many on-line coding clubs. Trinket is fully web-based and does not require any software to be installed. We also have many advanced Python labs and a gentle pathway to data literacy using Jupyter Notebooks. Java - Java is suggested after students have mastered Python concepts. Getting started with Java is a bit more challenging since even small programs require more code and a deeper understanding of complex programming concepts. We are still working on finding instructors and materials for Java. Stand by for more. Linux/UNIX and Pi - Students that want to do work with the Raspberry Pi often need to understand basic UNIX commands and basic UNIX shell programming. We are working on putting these materials on line. Web and User Experience - Creating web pages is a fun way to learn how to build great user experiences. We are working on putting these materials on line. [App Inventor] https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/app-inventor Learn how to build your own mobile apps (Android only) with AppInventor, a powerful, visual programming tool from MIT. Arduino - Want to control things in the real world through computer programming? In this group, you\u2019ll go step-by-step, wiring lights, sounds and sensors up through an Arduino board into a computer, then programming them to do cool things. No experience needed! Arduino Robot Content yet to be moved: http://dmccreary.github.io/coderdojo-robots/arduino/00-intro/ LED Strip labs GitHub Pages yet to be moved to mkdocs: http://dmccreary.github.io/moving-rainbow/ Unity Game Engine Enjoy making games and sophisticated graphics with professional level software. Best for ages 10+ or experienced younger coders. AI Racing League - Learn the principals of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence by training a small car to drive around a track by itself. This popular project is build around the DonkeyCar system and our volunteers are working hard to make the cars easier for everyone to learn. Some experience with Python and UNIX is very helpful.","title":"Code Groups"},{"location":"content-stewards/","text":"Here is a list of the content stewards: Python - Juhl, Kirstin and Prem Sagar Vij, Vikas Vij https://coderdojotc.github.io/python/ Scratch - Agrawal, Anuj [MBM] https://coderdojotc.github.io/scratch/ Linux/UNIX and Pi - Walters, Jim Web and User Experience - Agrawal, Anuj [MBM] https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/web-ux App Inventor Negron, Martha A and Craver, Shawn https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/app-inventor Arduino (with TinkerCad) \u2013 Needs a new volunteer to work with Dan McCreary https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/arduino Arduino Robot Content yet to be moved: http://dmccreary.github.io/coderdojo-robots/arduino/00-intro/ LED Strip labs GitHub Pages yet to be moved to mkdocs: http://dmccreary.github.io/moving-rainbow/ Unity Game Engine \u2013 no volunteers yet https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/unity-game-engine AI Racing League \u2013 Dan McCreary \u2013 needs to be migrated to mkdocs format https://coderdojotc.github.io/ai-racing-league/#/README Content testing team: Luckett, Lisa A, Swanson, Nicolle M,","title":"Content stewards"},{"location":"getting-started/","text":"Here is a list of the content stewards: Python - Juhl, Kirstin and Prem Sagar Vij, Vikas Vij https://coderdojotc.github.io/python/ Scratch - Agrawal, Anuj [MBM] https://coderdojotc.github.io/scratch/ Linux/UNIX and Pi - Walters, Jim Web and User Experience - Agrawal, Anuj [MBM] https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/web-ux App Inventor Negron, Martha A and Craver, Shawn https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/app-inventor Arduino (with TinkerCad) \u2013 Needs a new volunteer to work with Dan McCreary https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/arduino Arduino Robot Content yet to be moved: http://dmccreary.github.io/coderdojo-robots/arduino/00-intro/ LED Strip labs GitHub Pages yet to be moved to mkdocs: http://dmccreary.github.io/moving-rainbow/ Unity Game Engine \u2013 no volunteers yet https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/unity-game-engine AI Racing League \u2013 Dan McCreary \u2013 needs to be migrated to mkdocs format https://coderdojotc.github.io/ai-racing-league/#/README Content testing team: Luckett, Lisa A, Swanson, Nicolle M,","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"contact/contact/","text":"STEM Mentor Volunteering \u00b6 Here are some contacts: Timothy Thomason - our STEM Mentor leader Nicolle Swanson - registration for new mentors Dan McCreary - technical contact for mentor resources content management Edit docs/contact/contact.md to update this page","title":"Contact"},{"location":"contact/contact/#stem-mentor-volunteering","text":"Here are some contacts: Timothy Thomason - our STEM Mentor leader Nicolle Swanson - registration for new mentors Dan McCreary - technical contact for mentor resources content management Edit docs/contact/contact.md to update this page","title":"STEM Mentor Volunteering"},{"location":"documentation/documentation/","text":"Hey there \ud83d\udc4b \u00b6 This is the documentation page Edit docs/documentation/documentation.md to update this page","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"documentation/documentation/#hey-there","text":"This is the documentation page Edit docs/documentation/documentation.md to update this page","title":"Hey there \ud83d\udc4b"},{"location":"faq/faq/","text":"STEM Mentor FAQs \u00b6 What is the Optum STEM Mentoring Program \u00b6 This is a program to help Optum staff connect with local coding clubs so they can help mentor students. This includes both children of Optum families as well as outside students. Our short term focus is helping our parents that have had their students summer programs canceled during the COVID pandemic. How to we get involved? \u00b6 You can sign up via eventbright here: Do I have to be a software developer to be a mentor? \u00b6 No. Our best mentors are people that like to work with students and have strong empathy. Our focus is teaching the most basics concepts of computer science (variables, loops, conditional etc.) Most non-programmers can pickup the basic coding quickly, in just a few hours. To get a sample of this try our Turtle Graphics Tutorial . How do we start a local coding club? \u00b6 https://coderdojo.com/start-a-dojo What is CoderDojo? \u00b6 CoderDojo is an international non-profit organization and movement that promotes coding for youth. The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important in the modern world, that it\u2019s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so. There are currently over 2,200 CoderDojo clubs around the world. CoderDojo also provides a set of guidelines for coding clubs. To create a local CoderDojo club you must adhere to a set of principals such as background checks for all mentors, no fees for attending, and no more than 3 students per mentor. CoderDojo also provdes extensive best practices for organizing and mentoring students. How do I contribute new training content? \u00b6 We are working on this. Right now we are using GitHub pages and mkdocs to store and publish our content. To add content you must learn how to use the Markdown language and submit a GitHub pull request. We are working on tools to make it easier to create and share content. Other organizations are also using GoogleDocs to share mentoring materials. Note that since GoogleDocs is blocked by Optum firewalls it is best to author the content outside of the Optum firewalls and then publish this content. Once the content is published the Optum firewalls don't block the content.
