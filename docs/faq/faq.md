## STEM Mentor FAQs

### What is the Optum STEM Mentoring Program
This is a program to help Optum staff connect with local coding clubs so they can help mentor students.  This includes both children of Optum families as well as outside students.  Our short term focus is helping our parents that have had their students summer programs canceled during the COVID pandemic.

### How to we get involved?
You can sign up via eventbright [here:](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/optum-stem-outreach-virtual-training-series-tickets-107111978812)

### Do I have to be a software developer to be a mentor?
No.  Our best mentors are people that like to work with students and have strong empathy.  Our focus is teaching the most basics concepts of computer science (variables, loops, conditional etc.) Most non-programmers can pickup the basic coding quickly, in just a few hours.  To get a sample of this try our [Turtle Graphics Tutorial](https://coderdojotc.github.io/python/trinket/00-introduction/).

### How do we start a local coding club?

### What is CoderDojo?
CoderDojo is an international non-profit organization and movement that promotes coding for youth.
The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important in the modern world, that itâ€™s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so.  There are currently over 2,200 CoderDojo clubs around the world.  CoderDojo also provides a set of guidelines for coding clubs. To create a local CoderDojo club you must adhere to a set of principals such as background checks for all mentors, no fees for attending, and no more than 3 students per mentor.  CoderDojo also provdes extensive best practices for organizing and mentoring students.

### How do I contribute new training content?
We are working on this. Right now we are using GitHub pages and mkdocs to store and publish our content.  To add content you must learn how to use the Markdown language and submit a GitHub pull request.  We are working on tools to make it easier to create and share content.

Other organizations are also using GoogleDocs to share mentoring materials.
Note that since GoogleDocs is blocked by Optum firewalls it is best to author the content outside of the Optum firewalls and then publish this content.  Once the content is published the Optum firewalls don't block the content.

### What is the long-term vision
We hope to be able to curate content to make it
