If you are a new mentor, feel free to tell your student.  Tell them that you write code every day but you have never taught a subject or taught a subject to a 10-year-old student.  Ask them if they would help you become a good mentor.

Ask them if they have any specific learning goals.

Ask them if they have used the language before.  What did they learn?  What did they like?

Start slow and listen to their feedback.  Ask them about their feelings.  Tell them
that programming can sometimes get frustrating and it is OK to talk about theses
feelings.
