Welcome to your STEM Mentors web site!

The purpose of this site it to store internal Optum content for STEM volunteer mentors.

We are also working with the [CoderDojo Twin Cities](https://coderdojotc.org/) to share content.

Examples of public content:

* [CoderDojo Twin Cities Python Site](https://coderdojotc.github.io/python/)
* [CoderDojo Twin Cities Scratch Site](https://coderdojotc.github.io/scratch/)
* [AI Racing League](https://coderdojotc.github.io/ai-racing-league)

## How we built this site
This site was built with the [Optum Microsite Builder](https://microsite-docs.optum.com) and
the [mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org) system using the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).


Our goal is to understand if non-technical users can create and manage training content on these sites.
