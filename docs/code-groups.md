# CoderDojo Twin Cities Coding groups
This guide helps you decide which code group are active and what coding groups you could join.

## Scratch
**Recommended for Ages:** 7-14 <br/>
Just getting started with coding?  This is the first coding group we want you to consider.
If is ideal if you don't yet have strong keyboarding skills or are using an iPad to learn coding.  For example can you use the copy/cut and paste functions without using the mouse?  Scratch is a  popular block programming language supported by MIT.  Students can build small programs just by placing blocks on the screen. You can learn more about scratch by visiting the CoderDojo and MIT 
Scratch sites listed below:

* [Scratch Resources for Students and Mentors](https://coderdojotc.github.io/scratch/)
* [MIT Scratch web site](http://scratch.mit.edu).

## Python
**Recommended for Ages:** 10-18<br/>
If your student has strong keyboarding skills and has mastered the copy/cut and paste functions then we strongly recommend you start with Python.  Python has been the most popular introductory programming language since 2014 because it is has a clean syntax and there are many tools especially designed for beginners.  Our starting curriculum is based on the popular [Trinket](http://trinket.io) system used by many on-line coding clubs.  Trinket is fully web-based and does not require any software to be installed.  We also have many advanced Python labs and a gentle pathway to data literacy using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Web and User Experience
**Recommended for Ages:** 10-18<br/>
Creating web pages is a fun way to learn how to build great user experiences.  We have extensive materials and lesson plans for learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and web drawing with SVG.  We use a variety of web-based tools to learn how to program with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG.

## Thunkable
**Recommended for Ages:** 10-18<br/>
Thunkable is a new web-based block programming tool that allows students to build both iPhone and Android applications.

## Arduino ##
[Arduino](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/arduino) - Want to control things in the real world through computer programming? In this group, youâ€™ll go step-by-step, wiring lights, sounds and sensors up through an Arduino board into a computer, then programming them to do cool things. No experience needed!

### Arduino Robots
**Recommended for Ages:** 10-18<br/>
Arduino Robot Content yet to be moved: 
[Arduino Robots Site](http://dmccreary.github.io/coderdojo-robots/arduino/00-intro/)
Ages: 12-18

## Arduino LED Costumes
**Recommended for Ages:** 10-18<br/>
LED Strip labs GitHub Pages yet to be moved to mkdocs.
[Moving Rainbow](http://dmccreary.github.io/moving-rainbow/)
<br/>**Ages:** 12-18

## Linux/UNIX and Pi
**Recommended for Ages:** 13-18<br/>
!!! warning
    We have not moved our Raspberry Pi programming on-line yet.  If you have ideas on how to do this, please let Dan McCreary know.

Students that want to do work with the Raspberry Pi often need to understand basic UNIX commands and basic UNIX shell programming.  We are working on putting these materials on line.
<br/>**Ages:** 12-18


## Unity Game Engine

!!! warning
    Our Unity Game Engine courses have not been moved online.  They require extensive desktop setup and many of our students don't have high-end system that are required to run Unity.  We hope to resume Unity when we return to our physical classrooms.

[Unity Game Engine](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/unity-game-engine)
Enjoy making games and sophisticated graphics with professional level software.  Best for ages 10+ or experienced younger coders.
<br/>**Ages:** 12-18

## AI Racing League
**Recommended for Ages:** 14-18<br/>

!!! warning
    Our AI Racing League courses have not been moved online.  We know of other DonkeyCar clubs that are now doing "virtual races" but we don't have the experienced volunteers to migrate our content.

Learn the principals of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence by training a small car to drive around a track by itself.  This popular project is build around the DonkeyCar system and our volunteers are working hard to make the cars easier for everyone to learn.  Some experience with Python and UNIX is very helpful.  We are also looking for mentors to help us migrate the existing Markdown content to use the [mkdocs](glossary.md#mkdocs) standards.

## Java
!!! warning
    Due to reliability problems with our on-line [Repl.io](https://repl.it/) Java VM engines we are not teaching Java in our Zoom-based classes at this time.  Mentors and students are welcome to use the material we have created with the understanding that students will need to load Java development tools on their local desktops.  If you have suggestions on how to teach Java without local installation of software please let us know.

[Java](ttps://coderdojotc.github.io/java/) - Java is suggested after students have mastered Python concepts.  Getting started with Java is a bit more challenging since even small programs require more code and a deeper understanding of complex programming concepts.  We are still working on finding instructors and materials for Java.  Stand by for more.
<br/>**Ages:** 14-18

## App Inventor

!!! warning
    We are migrating our mobile application development to [Thunkable](http://www.coderdojotc.org/thunkable/).  The primary reason for this is that Thunkable works on both iPhone and Android and our younger students like the block-programming capability offered by Thunkable.  Our virtual training also allows us to not have to install local applications on the students local system.

    The App Inventor content will not be maintained in the future.

[App Inventor](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/app-inventor)
