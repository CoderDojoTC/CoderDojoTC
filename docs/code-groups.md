Which code group should you join?

[Scratch](https://coderdojotc.github.io/scratch/)
This is an ideal site if your students don't yet have strong keyboarding skills.  For example can they
use the copy/cut and paste functions without using the mouse?  Scratch is a very popular block
programming language supported by MIT.  Students can build small programs just by placing blocks on the screen. You can learn more about scratch by visiting the
[MIT Scratch web site](http://scratch.mit.edu).

[Python](https://coderdojotc.github.io/python/) - If your student has strong keyboarding then we strongly recommend
you start with Python.  Python has been the most popular introductory programming language since 2014 because it
is has a clean syntax and there are many tools especially designed for beginners.  Our starting curriculum is based on the popular [Trinket](http://trinket.io) system used by many on-line coding clubs.  Trinket is fully web-based and does not require any software to be installed.  We also have many advanced Python labs and a gentle pathway to
data literacy using Jupyter Notebooks.

[Java](ttps://coderdojotc.github.io/java/) - Java is suggested after students have mastered Python concepts.  Getting started with Java is a bit more challenging since even small programs require more code and a deeper understanding of complex programming concepts.  We are still working on finding instructors and materials for Java.  Stand by for more.

[Linux/UNIX and Pi](ttps://coderdojotc.github.io/java/) - Students that want to do work with the Raspberry Pi often need to understand basic UNIX commands and basic UNIX shell programming.  We are working on putting these materials on line.

[Web and User Experience](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/web-ux) - Creating web pages is a fun way to learn how to build great user experiences.  We are working on putting these materials on line.


[App Inventor]
https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/app-inventor
Learn how to build your own mobile apps (Android only) with AppInventor, a powerful, visual programming tool from MIT.

[Arduino](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/arduino) - Want to control things in the real world through computer programming? In this group, youâ€™ll go step-by-step, wiring lights, sounds and sensors up through an Arduino board into a computer, then programming them to do cool things. No experience needed!

[Unity Game Engine](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/unity-game-engine)
Enjoy making games and sophisticated graphics with professional level software.  Best for ages 10+ or experienced younger coders.

[AI Racing League](https://coderdojotc.github.io/ai-racing-league/#/README) - Learn the principals of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence by training a small car to drive around a track by itself.  This popular
project is build around the DonkeyCar system and our volunteers are working hard to make the cars easier for
everyone to learn.  Some experience with Python and UNIX is very helpful.
