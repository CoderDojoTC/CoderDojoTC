## Kind vs. Wicked Learning Environments
When we design ciricculum for our CoderDojo students we are striving for a "kind" learning environment. Kind learning systems are contrasted to "wicked" Learning by the following concepts:

|Kind|Wicked|
|--|--|
|Patterns repeat|Patterns not obvious or repeating|
|Feedback accurate and rapid|Feedback delayed and inaccurate|
|Rules well defined|Rules unclear and incomplete|
